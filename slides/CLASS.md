 [X] 0003_alter_user_email_max_length
 [X] 0004_alter_user_username_opts

## Rewinding Database Migrations

Take auth app to migration 0004

```
$ python manage.py migrate auth 0004
Operations to perform:
  Target specific migration: 0004_alter_user_username_opts, from auth
Running migrations:
  Rendering model states... DONE
  Unapplying auth.0006_require_contenttypes_0002... OK
  Unapplying auth.0005_alter_user_last_login_null... OK
```

App migration state after operation

```
$ python manage.py showmigrations auth
auth
 [X] 0001_initial
 [X] 0002_alter_permission_name_max_length
 [X] 0003_alter_user_email_max_length
 [X] 0004_alter_user_username_opts
 [ ] 0005_alter_user_last_login_null
